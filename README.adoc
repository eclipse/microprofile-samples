# MicroProfile - Samples

## Purpose of these samples

Give different examples using the MicroProfile :

* **Canonical** Simplest sample using JAX-RS 2.0 / CDI 1.2 / JSON-P 1.0
* **Swagger** Adding Swagger to the canonical sample

## Building

To build these examples you can just :

* `mvn clean install` does not run any test
* `mvn clean install -Plicense,skipTests` checks the licenses and does not run any test

## Formatting Code

To format / re-format code call :

* `mvn clean compile -PformatCode` formats the source code and does not run any test

## Testing

These examples use Arquillian Tests. By default, Arquillian uses WildFly embedded, but other forms of containers can also be plugged in.

* `mvn clean test -Pwildfly-swarm`  tests against a WildFly Swarm
* `mvn clean test -Parquillian-wildfly-managed`  tests against an embedded WildFly
* `mvn clean test -Parquillian-wildfly-remote` tests against a running WildFly
* `mvn clean test -Parquillian-tomee-managed`  tests against an embedded Apache TomEE
* `mvn clean test -Parquillian-tomee-remote` tests against a remote Apache TomEE

## Running

You can package a WAR file and deploy it on your application server. Once deployed and up and running, just go to `http://localhost:<portNumber>/msTopCDs` to invoke the microservice. You should get a list of random "Top Rated CDs" in JSON format, such as :

    [
        {
            id: 1101
        },
        {
            id: 1147
        },
        {
            id: 1112
        },
        {
            id: 1132
        },
        {
            id: 1168
        }
     ]

But you can also use other forms of packaging to execute this services

### WildFly Swarm

Package the samples with WildFly Swarm using the following Maven command :

* `mvn clean package -Pwildfly-swarm`

This will create an executable JAR under the `target` directory. Just execute it with `java -jar target/microprofile-sample-canonical-swarm.jar` and invoke the microservice at http://localhost:8081/msTopCDs
